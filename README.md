# CodeMorph

CodeMorph is a VS Code extension that automatically converts code when you rename a file to a different language.

### ✨ Currently supported (v1)
- Java ↔ Python

More languages coming soon.

---

## 🚀 How it works

1. Create or open a file (e.g. `Example.java`)
2. Rename it to another language (e.g. `Example.py`)
3. Confirm conversion
4. Done ✅

CodeMorph handles the rest.

---

## 🔐 Safety & Trust

- Conversion only happens after explicit confirmation
- Original file can always be restored using **Undo**
- No file is changed if conversion fails

---

## ⚙️ Setup (Required)

CodeMorph uses Google Gemini.

1. Get a Gemini API key
2. Open **Settings → CodeMorph**
3. Paste the key into `codemorph.geminiApiKey`

---

## 📌 Notes

- v1 is completely free
- Designed to be safe, simple, and non-destructive
- Best for learning, interviews, and quick language switches

---

## 🧭 Roadmap

- More languages
- Diff preview
- Migration modes
- Pro features (optional)

Built with ❤️ for developers.
